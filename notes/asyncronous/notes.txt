async wraps fn in asyncronous version
    this is the coroutine

to run coroutine, must await it in some way
    aka add it to the event loop
    this can be done by creating a task
        allows you to run different coroutines concurrently

to start asyncronous program, create event loop
    asyncio.run(main())
        main() is the entry point coroutine

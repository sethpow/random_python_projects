Unit Test Isolation with:
    - Test Doubles: objects used in unit tests as replacements to the real production system collaborators
        - (all code depends on other parts of the system)
        - (those other parts of the system are not always easy to replicate in the unit test environment, or
        would make tests slow if used directly)

    Types of Test Doubles
        - Dummies
            - obj's/placeholders passed around, but should not be called/used
            - objects that can be passed around as necessary
            - do not have any type of test implementation and should not be called/used
            - often generate exceptions if called
        - Fakes
            - these obj's generally have a simplified functional implementation of a particular interface that
                is adequate for testing, but not production
            - usable in test code, but not for production
        - Stubs
            - these obj's do expect to be called (provide implementations) but respond with canned answers
                that are suitable for the test
        - Spies
            - these obj's provide implementation that record the values passed in so they can be used by test
            - used for test validation
        - Mocks
            - these obj's are pre-programmed to expect specific calls and param's and can throw exceptions when
                necessary
            - have pre-programmed exceptions about the ordering of calls, # of times fn's will be called, and
                values that will be passed in
            - generate their own exceptions when these pre-programmed expectations are not met

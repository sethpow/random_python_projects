data encryption standard
    it is a form of feistal cipher (see feistal cipher  folder)

symmetric key algorithm
    public and private keys

block cipher
    (plaintext is processed to the cipher text in number of blocks)

hybrid of substitution cipher and permutation cipher
    (not able to use frequency analysis to crack DES)
    

Q&A
We split the plain text into 64 bits long blocks
there are 16 rounds in the DES cryptosystem
What is the aim of the initial permutation (IP) table?
    - defines the order (location) of the bits of the 64 bits long input

A single S-BOX contains 64 items
How many S-BOXES are present in the DES cryptosystem?
    - 8

What is the size of the DES's key space?
    2^56
Linear cryptoanalysis tries to find an f linear approximation such that ciphertext = f(plaintext,key)
What is differential cryptoanalysis?
    - tries to map bitwise ∆X differences in the input (plaintext) to ∆Y differences in the output (ciphertext)





encyption:
    split into 16 steps, each with a key

decryption:
    follow same 16 steps but with keys in reverse order

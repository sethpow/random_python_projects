OTP (aka Vernam cipher)
use as many letters in the key as the length of the plain text
    - with this, frequency analysis can still be used on cipher text, b/c english letters have well known distribution

SOLUTION: OTP can solve that as well
    - use totally RANDOM numbers to shift the letters in the plain text
    
        - *** key must have the same size as the plain text ***
            - *** key must contain RANDOM numbers ***

    - RANDOM numbers eliminate information leaking

HOWEVER, OTP STILL USES PSEUDO-RANDOMNESS (see RANDOMNESS pictures)

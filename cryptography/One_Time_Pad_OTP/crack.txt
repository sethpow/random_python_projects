# Shannon's secrecy

since the message equals [X] length and the ciphertext and/or key is same length, it becomes nearly
impossible to crack

ex:
original_text = "Woofer"
encrypted_text = "GWFCSQ"

Perfect Secrecy
    message space size is the same as the ciphertext space size
        you would have to look through EVERY english word that is 6 letters

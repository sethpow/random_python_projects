similar to caesar, but use several keys instead of just 1

- method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword
- polyalphabetic substitution
- easy to understand & implement


the numerical representations of the letters in the key define how many characters to shift the actual letter
in the plain text
S shifts 18
E shifts 3
C shifts 2
R shifts 17
E shifts 4
T shifts 19

instead of using a single value as the key, we have as many values as the numbers of letters in the private key
size of keyspace = 26^size of the key

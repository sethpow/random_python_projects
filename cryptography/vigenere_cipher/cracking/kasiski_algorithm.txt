cracking vigenere cipher is much harder
    caeser cipher keyspace = 26
    vigenere cipher keyspace = 26^size/length of key



can use the Kasiski algorithm
    - if we know the size of the key, then we can use frequency analysis to decrypt the cipher-text
    - take advantage of information leaking


algorithm:


1. we have to find size of key
    - can analyze repeated substrings and their factors to get a good guess
    - find repeated substrings in cipher-text
2. we can construct substrings from the cipher-text that are encrypted by the same letters
    - substrings that are 3 of same letters in a row appearing multiple times
        - find substrings of 3+ letters that occur more than once
        - then find distance from first letter in 1st occurance to first letter in next occurance
3. we can use frequency analysis to find the letters of the key
    - if we know the size of key, we can use frequency analysis, b/c vigenere cipher is same as caeser cipher
        - except for multiple keys
    - if the length of the key is N, then we know that every N-th letter must have been encrypted using same subkey
    - so we create substrings containing ever N-th letter
        - there will be N substrings after this operation
